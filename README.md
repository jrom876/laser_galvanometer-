# laser_galvanometer-
Laser Galvanometer driver with GUI, written in C and Python.

This software tracks targets and draws shapes with a laser galvanometer.

To track targets, simply provide xyz input coordinates (horizontal, vertical, and distance) from an external device, such as Open CV.

It can draw ellipses, cardioids, and rectangles but more shapes are certainly needed.

TODO: Create rotating platform with a stepper motor controller to point the laser 360 degrees (horizontal) x 110 degrees (vertical).
